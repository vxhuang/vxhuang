# Hello! 

Hi, I am Xinyuan Huang, a Postdoc researcher at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. I obtained my PhD in Environmental Engineering from Penn State University. I focused on exploring how mitigation policies affect air pollution, health burdens, and health inequities under future uncertainties using integrated assessment models. My current work focuses on modeling the speed limits in decarbonization pathways in the US and at the global scale. Prior to joining Penn State, I worked as a data scientist at S.F. Express, the largest logistics company in China. I like classical music, road trips, and some card games.
