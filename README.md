# Hello! 

Hi, I am Xinyuan Huang, a postdoc researcher at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. I work on modeling realistic global decarbonization pathways and assessing how institutional capacity affects the investment in low-carbon technologies across countries. I also worked on how mitigation policies affect air pollution, health burdens, and health inequities under future uncertainties using integrated assessment models. I received my PhD in Environmental Engineering from Penn State University. Prior to joining Penn State, I worked as a data scientist at S.F. Express, the largest logistics company in China. I like classical music, road trips, and some card games.
