# Hello! 

Hi, I am Xinyuan Huang, a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Penn State University. My advisor is [Dr. Wei Peng](https://www.weipengenergy.com). My current research explores how mitigation policies affect air pollution, health burdens, and health inequities under future uncertainties using integrated assessment models. Prior to joining Penn State, I worked as a data scientist at S.F. Express, the largest logistics company in China. I like classical music, road trips, and some card games.
